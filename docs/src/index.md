# StateSpaceModels.jl Documentation

## Installation

This package is registered in METADATA so you will can do `Pkg.add` it as follows:
```julia
pkg> add StateSpaceModels
```

## Notes

StateSpaceModels.jl is a package for modeling, forecasting and simulating time series in a state space framework based on structural models of Harvey (1989), in which a time series is decomposed in trend, slope and seasonals. Implementations were made based on the book "Time Series Analysis by State Space Methods" (2012) by J. Durbin and S. J. Koopman.

## Features

Current features:
* Basic structural model (trend, slope, seasonal)
* Exogenous variables
* Square-root Kalman Filter and smoother
* Big Kappa initialization
* Monte Carlo simulation
* Maximum likelihood estimation
